Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow by choosing the most appropriate of the options lettered A-E

There was once a terrible famine in the land of the animals. Food and money were scarce. Hunger made all the creatures very weak. The mother of Dino, the tortoise, fell ill and was at the point of death. Dinso became very worried because he had no money for her funeral ceremonies. He thought and thought but did not know what to do.

At last, he discovered a trick. He assembled all the animals and said to them, 'I am going to a distant land in search of food for all of us who are hungry, do not send for me unless something unusual happens.' The animals agreed.

Three days later, Dinso's mother died. Death is not unusual and Dinso could not be sent for. Discovering the trick, the elephant advised, 'Let's tell Dinso that the palm tree bears fruits at the end of its leaves. This unusual and should make him return quickly.'

The other animals welcomed the idea, thanked the elephant for the good advice and sent for Dinso. On hearing of palm trees bearing fruits at the end of the leaves, he hastened back. When he arrived, the animals said to him, 'Your mother is dead; now arrange for her funeral according to our custom. You can't deceive all the people all the time.'",,,,,,

JSS3_ENG,"[PASSAGE] PASSAGE II
Until the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Europeans knew little about the interior of Africa by then, much had been learnt about America, Asia and Australia. Because the Europeans knew little about Africa then, this was the chief reason why Stanley, the British explorer, called Africa 'The Dark Continent'.

Stanley explored the Congo Basin. The Stanley Falls on this river is called after his name. Most of the inhabitants of Africa are black in complexion and perhaps this was the second reason the words Dark-Continent were applied to Africa.

One may ask why the inland part of Africa was unknown until about one hundred years ago. Many are of the opinion that this was because the natives of Africa were not friendly towards Europeans. Until then, Arab slave raiders had been enslaving Africans. This made many Negroes look upon all white people as slave dealers.

But we must not forget the difficulties in exploring Africa. The Sahara Desert, the rapids on rivers and the thick forest made travelling very difficult. The damp, heat, mosquitoes and tse-tse flies caused illness to European explorers.",,,,,,
