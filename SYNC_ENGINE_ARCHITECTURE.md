# Custom Sync Engine Architecture & Concepts

## üéØ Overview

This document explains the comprehensive sync engine that bridges our local SQLite database with the remote PostgreSQL database on NeonDB. The sync engine is the heart of our offline-first architecture, ensuring data consistency while providing a seamless user experience regardless of network connectivity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQLite Configuration Impact on Sync Engine

### Current SQLite Pragma Settings

Our local SQLite database is configured with specific optimizations that directly influence how the sync engine operates:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;        -- Write-Ahead Logging
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;         -- Referential integrity enforcement
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;      -- Balanced durability vs performance
PRAGMA cache_size = 1000;         -- Memory pages for frequently used data
PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;       -- Temporary tables in RAM
```

### Sync Engine Implications

#### **WAL Mode Benefits for Sync Operations**

- **Concurrent Access**: Readers can access database while sync operations are writing
- **Non-Blocking Queries**: App continues functioning during sync without performance degradation
- **Atomic Transactions**: All sync operations are atomic and don't interfere with user actions
- **Hot Backup Capability**: Can read consistent snapshots during active sync operations

**Impact on Sync Strategy**:

- Sync operations can run in background without blocking user interactions
- Multiple sync operations can read data simultaneously
- User can continue taking quizzes while previous answers sync to remote
- No need to queue read operations during sync

#### **SYNCHRONOUS = NORMAL Considerations**

- **Performance Balance**: Faster than FULL synchronous but with slight durability trade-off
- **Sync Timing Critical**: There's a brief window where data might not be fully committed to disk
- **Crash Recovery**: Need to account for potential data loss in rare crash scenarios

**Impact on Sync Strategy**:

- **Wait for Commit**: Sync engine should wait for local transaction commit before marking as "ready to sync"
- **Verification Step**: Add post-transaction verification before remote sync
- **Retry Logic**: Account for potential local transaction rollbacks

#### **Foreign Keys ON Impact**

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures referential integrity during sync operations
- **Cascade Operations**: Deletes and updates properly cascade through related tables
- **Sync Order Dependency**: Must sync related data in correct order to maintain integrity

**Impact on Sync Strategy**:

- **Dependency-Aware Sync**: Sync parent records before child records
- **Integrity Validation**: Remote sync must respect same foreign key constraints
- **Rollback Safety**: Failed syncs won't leave orphaned records

#### **Memory Optimization (Cache + Temp Store)**

- **Performance**: Faster access to frequently used data during sync
- **Memory Pressure**: Sync operations should be mindful of memory usage
- **Batch Size Limits**: Large sync batches could overwhelm cache

**Impact on Sync Strategy**:

- **Smart Batching**: Optimize batch sizes based on available cache
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage during large sync operations
- **Cache-Friendly Operations**: Structure sync queries to leverage cached data

## üöÄ Initial App Installation & Setup Journey

### First Launch Experience

When a user first installs and launches the quiz application, several critical processes occur to establish the foundation for our dual-database architecture:

#### 1. **Local Database Initialization**

- **Purpose**: Create the primary local SQLite database that serves as the source of truth for user sessions
- **Process**: The app automatically creates the database file in the user's application data directory
- **Configuration**: Apply optimized pragma settings for sync-friendly operations
- **Tables Created**: Users, subjects, questions, quiz_attempts, sync_operations, and sync_timestamps
- **Initial State**: Empty database ready to receive data with WAL mode enabled

#### 2. **Network Connectivity Assessment**

- **Purpose**: Determine if initial data sync is possible
- **Process**: App performs connectivity check to NeonDB
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Online**: Proceed with initial data pull
  - **Offline**: Set up for manual data seeding

#### 3. **Initial Data Seeding Strategy**

The app follows a priority-based approach for populating initial data:

**Option A: Cloud Sync (Preferred)**

- Pull essential data from remote database
- Download: Subject definitions, question banks, user accounts
- **WAL Advantage**: Can continue app initialization while data downloads
- Benefit: Always up-to-date content

**Option B: Local Seeding (Fallback)**

- Use bundled CSV/JSON files included with app installation
- Load: Basic subjects, sample questions, default admin accounts
- **Concurrent Loading**: WAL mode allows app to start while seeding continues
- Benefit: Immediate functionality without internet

**Option C: Manual Import (Admin)**

- Excel file import functionality for institutions
- Custom user lists, subject-specific questions
- **Background Processing**: Import runs in background while app remains responsive
- Benefit: Tailored content for specific schools

#### 4. **Sync Engine Registration**

- **Purpose**: Establish the sync service as a background process
- **Process**: Register event listeners for network changes, app lifecycle events
- **Configuration**: Set sync intervals, retry policies, conflict resolution rules
- **WAL Integration**: Configure sync to leverage concurrent access capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Sync Engine Core Architecture

### Conceptual Foundation

The sync engine operates on the principle of **eventual consistency** - all data will eventually be synchronized across all instances, but temporary inconsistencies are acceptable for better user experience.

#### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Local-First Philosophy**

   - Local SQLite is always the primary source for user interactions
   - Remote database serves as backup and coordination hub
   - App functions fully even when completely offline
   - **WAL Mode Enables**: Uninterrupted local operations during sync

2. **Event-Driven Synchronization**

   - Sync operations triggered by specific events, not continuous polling
   - Efficient resource usage
   - Responsive to user actions and system changes
   - **Concurrent Operations**: Background sync doesn't block user interface

3. **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**
   - Predetermined rules for handling data conflicts
   - User data always takes precedence over administrative changes
   - Transparent conflict resolution without user intervention
   - **Integrity Maintained**: Foreign key constraints preserved during resolution

### Sync Operation Types

#### Push Operations (Local ‚Üí Remote)

**Purpose**: Send locally created/modified data to the cloud

**Data Types Pushed**:

- Quiz attempts (completed and in-progress)
- User-generated answers
- Session logs and performance metrics (ignore performance metrics for now)
- Error reports and diagnostics

**When Triggered**:

- **WAL Checkpoint**: Ensure data is written to main database file
- **Foreign Key Validation**: Verify all related data is consistent

#### Pull Operations (Remote ‚Üí Local)

**Purpose**: Retrieve updates from the cloud to local database

**Data Types Pulled**:

- New questions added by administrators (for now ignore adminstrators ui, any chnages need i will edit right from neondb)
- Updated subject information
- User account modifications
- System announcements

**When Triggered**:

- App startup (if online)
- Manual refresh requests
- Network reconnection events
- Scheduled background updates

**SQLite Integration**:

## üîÑ Conflict Resolution Framework

### Understanding Data Conflicts

Conflicts occur when the same piece of data has been modified in both local and remote databases. Our resolution strategy prioritizes user experience and data integrity while respecting SQLite's referential integrity constraints.

#### Conflict Categories

**Type 1: User Data Conflicts**

- **Scenario**: Student submits quiz while admin modifies questions (note if admin modify question it shoud not count as a conflict ones user as started a quiz attempt unless the user quiz attempt for that subject is cleared, for subsequent user taking that test you can update the lastest question can show)
- **Resolution**: User submission always wins (immutable principle)
- **Rationale**: Protects student work and maintains academic integrity
- **SQLite Handling**: Ensure foreign keys remain valid during resolution

**Type 2: Administrative Conflicts** (ignore)

- **Scenario**: Multiple admins modify same question simultaneously
- **Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison
- **Rationale**: Admin changes are typically coordinated and less frequent
- **SQLite Handling**: Update related records in dependency order

**Type 3: System Conflicts**

- **Scenario**: App version differences cause schema mismatches
- **Resolution**: Graceful degradation with data preservation
- **Rationale**: Ensures app continues functioning during updates
- **SQLite Handling**: Maintain foreign key integrity across schema changes

#### Resolution Process with SQLite Integration

1. **Conflict Detection**

   - Compare timestamps of local and remote data
   - Identify mismatched checksums or version numbers
   - Flag records with simultaneous modifications
   - **SQLite Verification**: Check transaction commit status

2. **Rule Application**

   - Apply predetermined resolution rules based on data type
   - Consider user context and operation priority
   - Maintain audit trail of all resolution decisions
   - **Foreign Key Validation**: Ensure resolution maintains referential integrity

3. **Data Merging**

   - Combine compatible changes when possible
   - Preserve conflicting data in separate fields
   - Create backup copies before overwriting
   - **Transaction Safety**: Perform all changes within single transaction

4. **Validation & Cleanup**
   - Verify merged data maintains integrity
   - Update all related records and references
   - Log resolution details for troubleshooting
   - **WAL Checkpoint**: Ensure changes are persisted to main database

### Practical Conflict Examples
